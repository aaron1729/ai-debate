    "reasoning": "While the con side raises valid points about terminology, the claim is substantially accurate. When climatologists refer to 'recorded history,' they typically mean the instrumental record dating back to 1958 for atmospheric CO2 measurements. The pro side effectively defended this interpretation with authoritative sources. The score of 8 reflects strong support with minor ambiguity around terminology."
